Would I go back to fix what we broke?  
Oh love, I don't know  
Because I didn't realize  
Something broken could still be so beautiful  
<!-- end-excerpt -->

Do I think was it worth the while?  
Of course, don't take it otherwise  
I loved those moments as they passed by  
Would I go back to that evening, that beautiful night?   

Your smell, your touch, your eyes  
I keep thinking about them every once in a while  
Even when the pain drags me under  
And the darkness creeps up inside  

I miss my princess, inside my arms  
The light of my darkness, my butterfly  
And every night, every day, every sunrise  
Your thought is all I have in mind
