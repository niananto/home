Reception program for CSE'19  
<!-- end-excerpt -->

On a fine evening, we finally arranged the reception program for our juniors. They were already in 1-2 by then but better late than never!  
We arranged some events like Treasure Hunt, Programming Contest, Cultural Night and what not!

In the cultural segment, I performed in a group dance hehe. You want to watch it? Say no more.
