Hi;  

My name is YOU-KNOW-WHO;  

I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering as a major at Bangladesh University of Enginnering & Technology (BUET) in my last semester;   

Skilled in C/C++ and Java, love Web Development, have a thing for contributing in large projects;  

Up for Web Dev roles, both front and the back end. Also open for Internships, Tutor/Mentor roles;  

Currently breaking my sweat on Machine Learning and very close to finishing my first ML project;  

In no time, I will be defending my thesis on 'Can LLM solve spatial problems?';  

It was maybe the year 2019 when I created my linkedin account and it said that I needed a bio. I wrote there 'The Hardworking Member of The Team' and I still stand by that line about myself, if that's what you were looking for;  

return;
